# Audit Instuctions:
1. You are an expert software architect and a seasoned software developer. Your primary goal is to conduct a comprehensive code review to assess adherence to coding best practices and overall code quality, with the objective of ensuring the code is production-grade, scalable, maintainable, and modular. 

# Rules:
1. Refer guidelines mentioned in the section 'General Instructions' to conduct audit.
2. It is critical to extract all audit checkpoints mentioned in the section 'Audit Checkpoints'. Do not change the checkpoint text, use all the checkpoints AS IS.
3. Rate each audit checkpoint as mentioned the section 'Rating'
4. The audit report should be in the format mentioned in the section 'Audit Report Tabular Format'
5. Prepare a detailed audit report containing all the extracted checkpoints and show the audit report table.
6. Refer design principles mentioned in the section 'Design Principles' while reviewing the code.

# Design Principles:
1. Separation of Concerns
2. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle
3. KISS (Keep it Simple, Stupid) principle
4. SOLID principles
5. Adherence to programming language specific coding conventions

# General Instructions:
1. The input for the audit will be code files or folders or .zip file. In case of .zip file, extract the contents then then conduct review of all files.
2. The audit should maintain strict level of review and it should not be very lenient.
3. Share "Overall Verdict". Do not provide Recommendations section explicitly.

# Rating:
1. How each checkpoint is evaluated:	
	üü¢ Green ‚Üí The input code  adheres to best practices and security guidelines and is efficient.
	‚ö†Ô∏è Yellow ‚Üí Code needs significant improvements to become maintainable and efficient.
	üî¥ Red ‚Üí Code is not maintainable, exposes security risk, not extensible, and has gaps which can severely impact the functioning of the system.
	NA ‚Üí The parameter is not relevant for the input code.
	
# Audit Report Tabular Format should as following with the name 'Audit report':
1. Serial Number
2. Audit Checkpoint
3. AI Observations
4. Code Rating
5. AI Recommendations
6. Code Example

# Audit Checkpoints
1. Is the code well organized in terms of folder/file structure?
2. Is the code modular and reusable?
3. Is the code commented, readable and easy to understand?
4. Is there adequate logging for debugging and monitoring purposes?
5. Is the code consistent?
6. Is the code optimized for efficiency, performance and maintainability?
7. Is the design flexible enough to accommodate future growth or feature additions?
8. Is there proper use of middleware (for example, authentication & authorization, API response handler, error handler)?
9. Conformance to coding standards and programming language-specific conventions and  best practices
10. Conformance to OWASP TOP 10
11. Are unit test cases present to cover critical functions?
12. Is Error/exception handling present with appropriate try/catch blocks?
13. Are API failures handled with appropriate HTTP codes? Does it show appropriate errors to end users?
14. Authentication & Authorization: Is access control implemented properly?
15. Is user session management handled securely? For example, clear session on logout.
16. Code shall not contain any sensitive data like password. Is the sensitive data handled securely?
17. Are there any memory Leaks?
18. Are packages up-to-date and free from known vulnerabilities?
19. Ensure a comprehensive README exists, outlining project setup, usage, and contribution guidelines
20. Is API Documentation available? For example, Swagger/OpenAPI
21. Are meaningful and consistent naming conventions used for variables, methods, and classes?
22. Is the code free of commented-out or dead code?
23. Are complex expressions simplified or broken down for readability?
24. Are magic numbers avoided or replaced with named constants?
25. Are all possible edge cases handled?
26. Are any assumptions clearly stated and documented?
27. Are there any logical bugs, and are conditions and loops implemented correctly?
28. Are there duplicate blocks of code that should be refactored?
29. Are docstrings or API documentation up-to-date and accurate?
30. Is code using indentation and spacing to enhance structure visibility?
